description: Produce auditable evidence that a completed change works, and publish it to the originating issue/PR. Decides whether evidence is required, delegates to a project-provided evidence harness when one exists (else captures a screenshot generically), writes evidence/evidence.json with a passed/skipped/failed/blocked status, and separately publishes an idempotent verified comment. Load after a change is implemented. Invoked by the /ops-evidence command and the plan-goal pipeline.

# Ops Evidence

Produce evidence of what a change actually did, store it inside the OpenSpec change (so it travels on archive), and surface it where an async reviewer will see it: a comment on the originating issue and PR.

Capture is best-effort and must never be fatal to a pipeline. But be honest about outcomes: a change that needed evidence and couldn't produce it is blocked, not skipped. Surface that honestly. Publishing is separate and, when a caller opts into it as a ship gate, may block shipping.

## Input

The caller provides (all optional):
- change id: locates `openspec/changes/{change-id}/` (or the archived `archive/*{change-id}/`).
- issue / work-item ref and PR number: where to publish. Absent means capture only.
- output mode (`default` / `push` / `pr`): whether the branch was pushed (decides whether image URLs resolve).
- operation: `capture` (default), `publish`, or `both`. plan-goal runs `capture` after archive and `publish` after push.

## The evidence contract

Evidence lives at `openspec/changes/{change-id}/evidence/` and follows the schema and status definitions in the [evidence contract](../ob-make-evidence-scaffold/evidence-contract.md) reference. That reference is the single source of truth for the `evidence.json` schema and status semantics.

## Part 1: Capture (operation: capture / both)

**Step 1: Decide whether evidence is required.** Inspect the change's `touches`/diff and proposal:
- Required when changed files include user-visible UI: components, pages/views/routes, styles (`*.css/scss/less`), `*.tsx/jsx/vue/svelte`, layout, navigation, dialogs/forms, or loading/empty/error/success states, or the proposal describes a UI/interaction/styling change.
- Skipped when the change is docs-only, an internal refactor with no visible behavior, dependency-only, test-only, logging-only, or backend/main-process-only with no user-visible component.
- Mixed or unknown: required (be safe).

If skipped: write `evidence.json` with `status: "skipped"` and reason, no assets, and stop. This is success.

**Step 2: Prefer a project-provided evidence harness.** Many mature repos build a deterministic harness (Playwright/Electron/Vite scenarios with assertions). If the project has one, delegate to it instead of a naive screenshot, it is more reliable and produces richer, asserted evidence. Detect it in this order:
- a `visual-evidence` script in `package.json`: run it: `pnpm visual-evidence --change {change-id}` (or the repo's package manager). Respect its exit codes: `0` passed/skipped, `1` failed, `2` blocked, `3` invalid input.
- a `visual-evidence` skill in `.agents/skills/`: load and follow it.
- a documented evidence entrypoint in `AGENTS.md` / `README.md`.

A project harness writes `evidence/` and `evidence.json` itself; consume its manifest and `prMarkdown` and skip to Part 2. If no harness exists, tell the user once that `/make-evidence-scaffold` can scaffold one, then fall back to Step 3.

**Step 3: Generic fallback capture (time-boxed, best-effort).** Only via `@browser-automation` (`localhost` only). Use the `browser-automation` skill's localhost scope rule: external services are out of scope for browser tools.
- Start/detect the app's dev server, navigate to the relevant route, wait for the UI to settle, screenshot.
- Enforce a time budget (~2 min). Server won't start / route 404s / budget exceeded: write `evidence.json` with `status: "blocked"` and reason, and continue. Do not retry more than once.
- Save into the change's `evidence/` folder, resolving where the change currently lives (active or already archived; prefer archived):

  ```bash
  REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
  DEST="$(ls -d "$REPO_ROOT/openspec/changes/archive/"*"{change-id}" 2>/dev/null | head -1)"
  [ -z "$DEST" ] && DEST="$REPO_ROOT/openspec/changes/{change-id}"
  mkdir -p "$DEST/evidence"
   # save the screenshot to "$DEST/evidence/01-final.png"
   ```

- Send command output and any intermediate capture files to `$REPO_ROOT/.opencode/.tmp/evidence-{change-id}/`, then copy final assets directly into `$DEST/evidence/`. Do not use an operating-system temporary directory.

**Step 4: Always write `evidence.json`.** Even non-UI/skipped/blocked changes get a manifest so the outcome is auditable. Write it and every final asset under `$DEST/evidence/`, with manifest paths matching that archived location. Build `prMarkdown` from the assets (or a text summary: tasks N/N, verification result, commit list).

Capture never commits, stages, or pushes. The caller owns git.

## Part 2: Publish (operation: publish / both, platform-specific)

Preconditions:
- An issue/work-item ref (and/or PR number) was provided. Else skip publishing.
- Image URLs resolve only if the branch was pushed. In `pr`/`push` modes embed images; in `default` mode post text evidence only (never a dead image link).
- Backlog platform from `.opencode/opencode-onboard.json` -> `platform.backlog`; `none`/`browser` means skip publishing.
- Publish one idempotent status comment for every manifest result. A `blocked` or `failed` result must state its status and reason; it must never be presented as passed.

The platform-specific publish procedure is injected by the CLI during onboarding:

<!-- OB-PLATFORM-EVIDENCE-START -->
**ALL GitHub data MUST come from `gh` CLI. NEVER use webfetch, HTTP requests, or browser MCP tools for GitHub. If `gh` is unavailable, skip publishing (report it) — do not fail the pipeline over it unless the caller declared publishing a ship gate.**
Always pass `--repo {owner}/{repo}` (or `repos/{owner}/{repo}` for `gh api`) explicitly.

Publish one status comment for every manifest. A `blocked` or `failed` manifest must include its status and reason, never a success claim.

### Step 1 — Build commit-pinned repository links

An embedded image must be a raw URL pinned to the commit that actually contains it, and that commit must be pushed. For each asset in `evidence.json`:

```bash
SHA="$(git log -n 1 --format=%H -- '{asset-path}')"          # the commit that added this asset
[ -z "$SHA" ] && echo "asset not committed: {asset-path}" && exit-skip
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{asset-path}?ref=$SHA" --silent   # 404 → not pushed yet → skip embedding
```

Build a blob link for every committed manifest and asset: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{SHA}/{asset-path}`. Use the raw URL only for a verified embeddable image: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{owner}/{repo}/{SHA}/{asset-path}`. If verification fails, include the asset path and SHA as text; never post a dead link.

### Step 2 — Build the comment body with a stable marker (idempotent)

Prefix the body with a hidden marker so re-runs update the same comment instead of piling on:

```
<!-- ob-visual-evidence:{change-id} -->

Status: `{status}`

{reason?}

Manifest: {commit-pinned evidence.json link}

Assets: {commit-pinned asset links}

{prMarkdown}
```

### Step 3 — Upsert the comment on BOTH the issue and the PR

For each target number (the originating issue, and the PR number when provided), find an existing marked comment and PATCH it, else POST a new one:

```bash
# find existing
ID="$(gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments" --paginate --jq \
  '.[] | select(.body | contains("<!-- ob-visual-evidence:{change-id} -->")) | .id' | head -1)"

if [ -n "$ID" ]; then
  gh api --method PATCH "repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/$ID" -f body="$BODY" --silent
else
  gh api --method POST  "repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments" -f body="$BODY" --silent
fi
```

- Text-only (no verified image, or `default` mode / nothing pushed): drop the image lines, keep the summary (tasks N/N, verification result, commits).
- If a comment call fails: report it. Fail the run ONLY when the caller declared publishing a ship gate; otherwise continue.
<!-- OB-PLATFORM-EVIDENCE-END -->

## Report

One block: the `status` (passed/skipped/failed/blocked) and why; assets written (paths) or why not; whether a comment was posted (and where) or why skipped. Never present a best-effort capture miss as a pipeline failure, but surface `blocked`/`failed` honestly.
