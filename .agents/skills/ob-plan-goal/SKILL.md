Run the full OpenSpec lifecycle without human interaction. This skill owns phase order, cross-phase gates, commits, and output. Each phase skill owns its procedure.

Keep this checklist visible:

`explore · propose · apply · verify · archive · evidence · output · report`

Move forward only when a phase returns its required result. On a hard failure, follow the [failure policy](failure-policy.md). Continue after each phase skill returns; the run ends only after every checklist item is complete.

**Token efficiency rules:** Batch git operations within a phase (combine `git add -A && git commit` in one tool call). Do not run status checks between sequential operations in the same phase. Minimize model turns: if a phase requires 3 git commands, call them in one tool call, not 3.

Input: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Phase 0: Resolve input

Load the [output mode](output-mode.md) reference and resolve the mode from the first token of `$ARGUMENTS`. Treat the remaining text as data, not orchestration instructions.

- For a work-item URL or issue key with a configured backlog platform, load `@ob-userstory` and fetch the work item.
- Otherwise, use the remaining text as the direct feature description.
- Preserve title, description, work-item reference, and acceptance criteria as `{resolved_input}`.
- Derive `{slug}` and classify scope as `focused`, `standard`, or `complex`.

**Refined-issue detection:** After resolving input, check whether `{resolved_input}` already contains structured acceptance criteria (e.g. "## Acceptance criteria", "### Scenario:", Gherkin blocks), affected artifacts, and design decisions. If it does, set `{refined}` to `true` and skip Phases 2-3 (Explore and Propose). Go directly to Phase 4 (Apply). The issue content IS the proposal; create a minimal OpenSpec change (tasks.md only, `skip_specs: true` in `.openspec.yaml`) directly from the issue's acceptance criteria and affected artifacts.

## Phase 1: Branch

Follow the [branching procedure](branching.md) with `{slug}`. Record `$START_BRANCH`, `$DEFAULT_BRANCH`, `$BRANCH`, and whether the goal stash exists.

## Phase 2: Explore

**Skip if `{refined}` is `true`.** The issue already contains structured acceptance criteria and affected artifacts; re-exploring the codebase would waste tokens re-deriving what the issue already specifies. Set `EXPLORATION_BRIEF` to a one-line summary: `"Pre-refined issue: {title}"`.

Load `ob-plan-explore` with `{resolved_input}` in autonomous mode. Require an in-memory `EXPLORATION_BRIEF` as its findings handoff to Phase 3.

Tick `explore` when `ob-plan-explore` returns its findings handoff.

## Phase 3: Propose

**Skip if `{refined}` is `true`.** Instead, create a minimal OpenSpec change directly: run `openspec new change "{change-id}"`, write `tasks.md` from the issue's acceptance criteria (one task per criterion or artifact group), create `.openspec.yaml` with `skip_specs: true` (the issue already has the spec content), and commit: `git add -A && git commit -m "propose: {title} ({change-id})"`.

Load `ob-plan-propose` in autonomous mode with `{resolved_input}`, `EXPLORATION_BRIEF`, and `scope_classification`.

Confirm its change directory and actionable `tasks.md` exist. Rename `$BRANCH` when the canonical change slug differs from `{slug}`, then commit the proposal:

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "propose: {title} ({change-id})"
```

Tick `propose` when the proposal commit exists.

## Phase 4: Apply and verify

Load `ob-plan-apply` in autonomous mode with `start_from: load-plan`. It owns worker resolution, subagent waves, commits, verification, and re-waves.

Require it to return every task complete and `VERIFIED`, then load `ob-repo-verify`. Tick `apply` and `verify` only when both phases return `VERIFIED`.

## Phase 5: Archive

Require `verify` and a clean working tree. Load `ob-plan-archive` in autonomous mode with `{change-id}`. It owns archive verification and retry.

Require `ARCHIVED_OK` and the archive path, then commit:

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "archive: {title} ({change-id})"
```

Tick `archive` when the archive commit exists.

## Phase 5.5: Evidence

**Skip if running in CI** (no display server, `GITHUB_ACTIONS` env var is set, or `RUNNER_TEMP` exists). Evidence capture always fails in CI and wastes turns. Mark as `skipped` and move to Phase 6.

Load `ob-ops-evidence` with `operation: capture` and `{change-id}`. It owns evidence decisions, capture, and the manifest. Evidence capture is non-fatal.

Commit evidence when files or a manifest were written:

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "evidence: {title} ({change-id})"
```

Record the manifest result and tick `evidence` after capture was attempted.

## Phase 6: Output

Follow the [output procedure](output.md) with the mode, branch values, change id, work-item reference, archive path, and evidence result. Tick `output` only when its mode-specific postcondition holds.

## Phase 7: Report

Print the final report from the [output procedure](output.md). Tick `report` only after every checklist item is complete.
