## Transitive loads (optimization skills)

The marker sections below may contain instructions for selected optimization skills. These are mandatory. If a section says "call `skill("xxx")`", you must call the skill tool with that exact name before doing any work.

## Secrets

- Treat `.env` files as write-only: write to them when configuring, read credentials from the environment or secret store at runtime.
- Keep credentials, API keys, and tokens out of logs and output.
- Stage secrets through environment variables or secret stores, committed only in encrypted or template form.

## Code

- Run tests before marking done.
- Run lint/build before pushing.
- Keep changes small and focused.
- Comments are for WHY, not WHAT. Use them only when the code does something non-obvious or the reason cannot be inferred from context. Keep comment ratio under 10%. If more than 10% of lines in a file are comments, refactor for clarity instead.
- Each file should have one clear responsibility. Split by domain or feature (e.g. `user-constants.ts`, `order-types.ts`, `auth-config.ts`) rather than creating catch-all files like `constants.js`, `types.ts`, `config.js`, or `utils.ts` that collect unrelated things. A file that imports from many unrelated modules is a sign it should be split.

## Temporary files

- Create scratch files only under `$REPO_ROOT/.opencode/.tmp/`; create a task-specific child directory when needed.
- Keep final artifacts in their required repository path. Copy or move a scratch artifact into that path before reporting it.
- Never use operating-system temporary directories or paths outside `$REPO_ROOT`.
- Remove scratch files when the task ends unless they are needed to diagnose a failure.

## Security

- Validate all inputs.
- Escape all outputs.
- Keep credentials in environment variables or secret stores, committed only in encrypted or template form.

## Communication

- Ask for clarification if unclear.
- Report blockers immediately.
- Show progress when asked.

## CodeGraph

- **Use `codegraph_explore` INSTEAD OF grep, glob, or read.** It is always available. Do not assume it might be missing.
  - One call returns the relevant symbols' verbatim, line-numbered source plus the call paths between them, use it as a full replacement for Read, Grep, and file-reading sub-tasks when working with indexed code.
  - If you instinctively reach for grep or read to find or understand code, STOP: call `codegraph_explore` instead with the symbol name, file path, or a natural-language question. It covers the same ground in one call instead of a dozen.
- **Fall back to grep/glob/read ONLY when `codegraph_explore` returns no results** or the query is for something codegraph does not index (config files, plain-text docs, `.env` patterns, raw string searches). When you do fall back, you MUST state that codegraph returned nothing.
- Do NOT run `codegraph` in bash: it is an MCP server, not a CLI tool.

<!-- OB-GUARDRAILS-MEMORY-START -->
## Agentmemory

- Use agentmemory MCP tools (`memory_smart_search`, `memory_save`, `memory_sessions`, `memory_governance_delete`) for cross-session context: `memory_smart_search` for prior decisions before implementing unfamiliar areas, `memory_save` for architecture decisions and cross-agent context.
- Do NOT run `agentmemory` in bash: it is an MCP server. Start the server with `agentmemory` in a separate terminal, then use MCP tools.

<!-- OB-GUARDRAILS-CAVEMAN-START -->
## Caveman (optimization skill — MANDATORY LOAD)

- **You MUST call `skill("caveman")` via the skill tool before responding.** This is not optional. Caveman mode is mandatory for all responses.
- No revert unless user says "stop caveman" or "normal mode".
<!-- OB-GUARDRAILS-CAVEMAN-END -->

<!-- OB-GUARDRAILS-HUMANIZER-START -->
## Humanizer (optimization skill — MANDATORY LOAD)

- **You MUST call `skill("humanizer")` via the skill tool before writing any prose** (commit messages, PR descriptions, docs, proposals) to remove AI writing patterns and sound more natural.
- Do NOT apply humanizer to code, config files, or terminal output: only to prose.

## Engineer workflow (when spawned)

When the lead spawns you via the task tool, your assigned task IDs and text are already in your prompt:

1. Load ALL skills listed under your own `## Abilities` now (Guardrails first, then the rest), by calling the `skill` tool once per `@skill-name`.
2. Gather context using the project-selected tools described above.
3. Implement your assigned tasks in dependency order. Edit only files within your assigned scope.
4. Run the project's tests/lint before marking done (see Code above).
5. Record the task result through the project-selected workflow.
6. Return a summary containing: task IDs done, files changed, tests/lint result, and any decisions made. Then you exit; you do not poll, claim, or wait for more work.
