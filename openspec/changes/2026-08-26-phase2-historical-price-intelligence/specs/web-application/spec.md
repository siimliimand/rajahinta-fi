# web-application Specification

## Purpose

Adds historical price and landed-cost charts to the presentation layer (T2.5), following the controlled-vocabulary, visual-neutrality, and data-freshness rules the Phase 1 pages already follow.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Historical charts in product views

The calculator result view and the compare page SHALL render a historical price chart and a historical landed-cost chart from the price-history API, with the tax-change attribution markers, reliability badges per series, and a statement of the earliest available observation date. Charts SHALL be hidden when the `enable_historical_price_intelligence` flag is disabled.

#### Scenario: Chart renders with attribution markers

- **WHEN** a user views a product whose history contains a TAX_RULE_CHANGE step
- **THEN** the chart SHALL mark that step and label it with the bounding rule version labels

#### Scenario: Flag hides charts

- **WHEN** the feature flag is disabled for the session
- **THEN** the historical charts SHALL not appear and no price-history request SHALL be made

### Requirement: Neutral, dependency-free chart rendering

Charts SHALL be implemented as SVG components with no new charting dependency, using neutral styling with no design element that suggests promotion of any merchant, and labels restricted to the controlled vocabulary (identification, classification, calculation, comparison).

#### Scenario: No promotional styling or vocabulary

- **WHEN** a chart renders merchant series
- **THEN** all series SHALL receive visually equal treatment and all labels SHALL come from the controlled vocabulary

### Requirement: Freshness indicators on historical data

Every chart series SHALL display the reliability status and the timestamp of the most recent observation it derives from.

#### Scenario: Stale series flagged

- **WHEN** a series derives from STALE observations
- **THEN** the chart SHALL show the STALE indicator rather than presenting the data as verified
