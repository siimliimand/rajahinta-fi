# landed-cost-calculator Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Offer-constrained calculation entrypoint

The Landed-Cost Calculator SHALL expose an internal entrypoint that computes item costs (retail price, alcohol excise, container duty, per-input reliability, classification, confidence) for a caller-specified retail offer, running the same engine code paths as the public single-product calculation. The public single-product behavior, including automatic selection of the lowest-priced offer, SHALL remain unchanged.

#### Scenario: Pinned-offer calculation matches engine outputs

- **WHEN** a caller requests the item-cost computation for a specific retail offer
- **THEN** the result SHALL be produced by the same tax, duty, classification, and confidence steps as the public calculation for that offer

#### Scenario: Public behavior unchanged

- **WHEN** a user runs a single-product calculation after this change
- **THEN** the result SHALL be identical to the prior behavior, selecting the lowest-priced offer automatically
