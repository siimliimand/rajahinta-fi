## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Scheduled rate review

The rate-review process SHALL run on a recurring scheduled job that checks for newly published official rate changes, rather than a hardcoded stub that always reports no changes.

#### Scenario: New rates detected

- **WHEN** the scheduled job detects newly published official rates
- **THEN** a manual/legal review entry SHALL be created before any dataset version goes live

#### Scenario: No auto-publish

- **WHEN** a rate change is detected
- **THEN** it SHALL never be published automatically; a confirmed review step is required

#### Scenario: Review task recorded

- **WHEN** a rate change review entry is created
- **THEN** it SHALL be persisted with a pending status for operators to inspect
